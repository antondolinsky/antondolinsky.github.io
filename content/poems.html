						In the time before sleeping
						The details of consciousness trickled away as sleepiness came on
						And more and more there was only consciousness itself
						Suddenly I felt there was no difference between
						This essential consciousness, bare of detail,
						And the bare consciousness that my mother,
						Who died twelve years ago, had in her own present
						And it seemed that in essence, she was looking at the darkened
						Room through my physical eyes as much as I was,
						And all other sentient beings of all times were looking out at the room too,
						United in the essential consciousness...
						I slept and had a dream
						Of following another woman's trail across the nation —
						I went across great corn fields
						Where there were high-tech rocket bases and strange
						Generals lecturing the soldiers,
						And I stared in loneliness at maps showing the big
						Desert and rock places, and then the big lake areas
						And followed her path across the map with my thought
						As all around for miles it seemed there was just wind
						At the fluttering of grass, and a pack heavy on my shoulders...
						I asked of her in hobo encampments
						And stared mournfully at tattered paper in a locker
						One time somewhere in the northwest I saw a half-drunk
						Glass of old orange juice dusty by a window in a shack
						In the woods, and there was a fly floating in it, and I moved on
						But I never feared for that other traveler, for I knew her skill
						Only I for some reason of my own was searching...
						And I woke up in my room again, and I thought again
						Of the one consciousness, and the absurdity of the
						Narratives that cling to the body and try to make mortal passing
						Things eternal
						And I thought of romance and its chemical highs
						Which is shallow, but breeds poetry as it does something to the mind
						I thought of the eternity of childhood, the tempest of youth,
						And hopefully at some point one
						Starts to enjoy passion without delusion
						I thought of the ancient Greek...
						"As is the generation of leaves on the trees, so also is that of men
						The wind scatters leaves on the ground, but the blooming wood
						Produces others, and these grow after in the springtime —
						So is the generation of men — these spring forth, but those cease."
						But the light was shining in my room now
						And I wanted to get a cup of coffee
						I wanted to put it in words, which are leaky barrels
						But travel well, and sometimes there is something in the wood that adds a flavor.

						When the warm days creep up again
						And there is a stillness over downtown that the warm air spreads
						Although construction workers call out in the distance and big cranes rumble somewhere,
						Pulling their loads up
						I think of the East Bay
						And all those innocent years
						Hot baked sidewalk
						Telegraph
						Weed smell, cut grass smell, kisses
						Books and books, drinking mocha at Strada
						Years later bearing witness to populist rage
						In downtown Oakland
						The mystery of the great bulk of the country
						Swooping east past Lake Merritt and the hills
						The same subject I always come back to
						Something in the still air of a hot Bay Area day is eternal
						Those psychedelic times I had over there seem ancient,
						Like they happened in another age, before I went to high school
						Although they were after…
						From high school to my current intellectual mathematical stream
						Seems continuous
						Something about the psychedelic times stands out of that flow
						Like an HTML element positioned absolutely on a page
						And there was romance, too, a sticky mystery
						That never quite held, but always the gears ground on each other
						But it was redolent for a while of the thought of fabled suburban hush
						Under trees in the mystic small towns
						America
						Girls and boys cotton candy
						And Gatsby’s dream, too
						In the east where I knew a girl once
						By Long Island Sound, Manhatto and Providence
						In politics and lust there is a thing that makes the stars seem exquisite
						And the air, and the light
						When one is winning
						But who can I tell such things to?
						All or most people feel such subtleties
						As befit poems on poems
						But most don’t have the skill or desire to put them in words
						I feel like one of the few with voice
						Among mutes.

						The big lie is that the money was earned<br />
						But the city is full of the sickly vinegar smell of unearned money<br />
						1 am Saturday...<br />
						Teenagers in brand-new sports cars rip through the intersection<br />
						Past dancing lunatics covered in their own filth<br />
						It was more sane here<br />
						When the city was full of outwardly weird people -<br />

						The sun covers the truth in radiant beauty of warm color<br />
						But the night reveals everything<br />
						I took a bit of a jaunt around the town this year<br />
						Compelled by a combination of circumstance and desire,<br />
						I stayed at four different places and all four<br />
						Were marked by madness in some way.<br />
						There are criminals out there too,<br />
						Driven from the rest of the country by economic collapse<br />
						And social decay, they gather at the watering holes of the rich.<br />
						The only question that has any economic meaning here is<br />
						Who owns the land?<br />
						You can look up names on the city's website<br />
						But to find out what connects where you have to pry deeper<br />
						There are strange dog breed hybrids, sad poodles<br />
						With demented hair<br />
						Howling at the moon as the smell of jasmine flowers<br />
						Wafts through the air everywhere<br />

						Where the big waters surge in and surge out.<br />

						The first human feeling hits you<br />
						Exploding in the middle of your chest out through the barriers of shock<br />
						You explete energy by screaming until your inside is calm again<br />
						The world blurs for a moment, then becomes suddenly crisp<br />
						You feel the blood pumping through your own heart<br />
						Outside it is quiet<br />
						A few small clumps of people here and there on the street stare at phones together<br />
						The sky is normal<br />
						Small puffy clouds<br />
						The restaurant across the street still looks to be doing a bit of business<br />

I remember being mean, trying to not be mean, being mean. Years later, hearing the gull cries at night by Ghirardelli Square on the other side of the bay. One lone cab coming through the fog to get me, bring me back to electric light and the computer screen, a well-furnished little nook. A different lover, me not mean anymore, but nothing erases the first dance.

						I really had nothing inside me to stop penetration<br />
						I only had visions inside me that swirled for miles<br />
						And the visitor would be caught in mist and stagnation<br />
						Where is she now? In what part of the world?<br />
						I remember our adventures, when at last we were honest<br />
						We advanced the flag of risk forward without thought of reward<br />
						And in many ways I was at last the one who cowered<br />
						Her hands on my chest, caresses I could not understand,<br />
						Roughened as I was by my life as a sort of child soldier,<br />

						There is length between that and this -<br />
						The magician who drums into being the difference of moment and moment has left his fingerprint<br />
						On the door of the house of the night.<br />
						Today, as in older days used to often happen, the sky sketched out a few poems for us to finish.<br />
						As horses flee a stable that is on fire, clouds fled East, away from the murmuring, drowsy sun that was setting.<br />
						Later, I sat in a bar watching basketball and wondering about the meaning of the great return.<br />
						I do not need to catch the evening in carnival beauty.<br />
						I have heard voices of angels tell me that the Earth is a sphere.<br />
						I have studied dreams written on ice in melting caves.<br />
						I met a stranger once who told me that he saw love as a yellow beetle that subsisted on the blood of youth;<br />
						But I did not believe him.<br />
						I drank wine on the beach where the armies of all human nations gathered to storm God;<br />
						And I remember the rising voice of another stranger who advised us to let all sentience join our crusade and our struggle...<br />
						But there is length between this and that.<br />
						Had we been born a thousand years from now, the music would be different, but the urge would be the same.<br />

						And the spell woven behind us, in our blind spot,<br />
						By all that which we have forgotten in our savage staring at the flame,<br />
						And the sudden coming of drums, violence and thunder,<br />
						And the garden in which raindrops are drying…<br />
						I think on these things, I raise myself again,<br />
