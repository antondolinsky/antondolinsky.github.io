						No! Bullshit!<br />

						In the very chilly autumn of the first year a loaf of bread cost $1.00 and the man made $15.00 per hour.<br />
						In the autumn of the next year, there were many beautiful orange leaves floating across the fingers of the wind. A loaf of bread cost $1.10 and he made $16.00 per hour.<br />
						Another year passed, and there was a mild autumn this time. He met a beautiful girl. They made love in his apartment, by the window. Cars made the leaves fly up from the gutters as they zoomed past his house. A loaf of bread cost $1.20, and he still made $16.00 per hour.<br />
						The year that followed, there was a terrorist attack. The government people wagged their fingers and said that we must pass the laws. A loaf of bread cost $1.30, and he made $18.00 per hour.<br />
						The next year, his grandfather died. The girl tried to comfort him. He passed his fingers along the concrete where his grandfather's name was etched. "I should buy new shoes", he thought for some reason. Then he thought of his grandfather again. He felt sad. A loaf of bread cost $1.40, and he was making $18.00 per hour.<br />
						The next year bread cost $1.60 a loaf. The government men said that the economy had been bad, but now it was getting better. He was making $18.00 per hour. In the evenings he watched television. The girl had left him. They wrote to each other sometimes.<br />
						Another year came. His job was replaced. But it was ok. He collected unemployment insurance. He sat in the room for long hours and tried to teach himself how to write computer programs. He wasn't making anything except the unemployment money. Bread cost $1.65 a loaf. I have my health, he thought.<br />
						The big boxer was going to fight the other big boxer. There was going to be an entertainment in the evening. He walked to the place where everybody would sit and watch the televisions.<br />
						There was a beautiful girl behind the counter. I bet her lips taste like cardboard, he thought. He closed his eyes. For some reason, he imagined a stamp being put on an envelope. He opened his eyes again. It was almost 9pm. Outside, stars were wheeling up into the sky. He could see them through the open door, glimmering, moving and not moving. Somewhere behind him two men were talking about god. Maybe the older one was a priest.<br />
						"Stupid", he thought. "There is no god."<br />
						They gave him his french fries and soon the boxers started to fight. Just outside the door, a bum was stumbling and talking to himself. The bum stank. $1.60 isn't bad, the man thought. $1.65 isn't bad. Decent fight. Lips like cardboard.<br />
