            I've been inspired by a question I received to write down my thoughts about how to start computer programming.
          </div>
          <div class="p">
            1) If possible, have something you actually want to create. An idea for a program. Be audacious. Don't limit yourself. As you work on your concept, you will naturally discover that you don't know how to do X, Y, Z, and so on... Go online and read about X, Y, Z, and so on.
          </div>
          <div class="p">
            2) Pick a friendly language in which you can start making cool stuff right away. I would suggest Javascript or Python. I myself prefer Javascript. You already have it: it's in your web browser, and in all modern browsers you can write Javascript in the "Development Console" and immediately run it from there. Python usually comes with a nice development environment called IDLE. In both, you can write code and run it on the fly by hitting Enter. A further nice thing about these two languages is that they both come with a lot of features that let you start making images and sounds and messing around with text easily.
          </div>
          <div class="p">
            3) Focus on learning the core concepts of programming. For most languages, core concepts include things like:
              - variables
              - scope
              - functions
              - value types
              - control flow (if, for, while, and so on)
              - how your language handles objects and methods, if it is object-oriented
              and so on...
              Learning programming seems intimidating to some people because it can appear like there are just so many things to learn, but there really aren't. Any programming language that you pick will really have only 10-20 core things to learn. That's the important stuff. If you master it, you'll be able to teach yourself everything else pretty easily. Speaking of which...
          </div>
          <div class="p">
            4) The absolute most important skill for a programmer, other than mathematics and programming itself, is being able to research how to do things and to teach oneself. The Internet will either give you the answer to, or give you enough information so that you yourself can figure out the answer to, pretty much any programming question you may have. But...
          </div>
          <div class="p">
            5) Avoid copy-and-paste coding. Some people try to build programs by finding bits of other people's code online and pasting them together. There is nothing wrong with using other people's code, as long as they are ok with it... but to really learn how to code, you should build things from scratch. If you write a line of code, you should preferably understand why every single letter, number, period, parenthesis, and every other character is in the place that it is. You should learn how the computer interprets every single character of your code, what the computer does with it. On a related note:
          </div>
          <div class="p">
            6) Don't code a certain way just because somebody advised you to code in that way. Take the time to actually understand the issue and form your own opinion.
          </div>
          <div class="p">
            7) Know that, once you develop a basic level of proficiency, you will be able to sit down and just type out long segments of code fluidly, without consciously thinking about what you are writing. It's sort of like writing a letter to a friend or playing a musical instrument. Sometimes you stop and think about what you're doing, and what to do next, but a lot of it becomes just doing. This is the famous flow-state, and it's a good feeling.
          </div>
          <div class="p">
            8) Learn to "be" the computer. You should be able to step through code line by line and, in your mind or a piece of paper, keep track of the data your code is working with and how each line changes that data. A computer does nothing that, in principle, you couldn't do on a piece of paper. It just does it billions of times faster than a human could. Speaking of paper...
          </div>
          <div class="p">
            9) Don't think of programming as something you need to be in front of a computer to do. Writing your code on paper, away from a computer, forces you to concentrate on getting it conceptually right. In front of a computer, you can code in the flow-state or by making little changes one by one and seeing what happens. Every now and then, though, it is very helpful to step back and think through what you are doing in a more total and conceptual way.
          </div>
          <div class="p">
            10) When first starting out, just mess around and have fun. At some point, however, learn what the computer is actually doing when it runs your code. Read about boolean logic, processors, memory, machine code, assembly, compilers, interpreters. Read about the history of computers. The history of computer languages. The differences between computer languages and how they came about. Learning about this stuff will SUBSTANTIALLY improve your coding.
          </div>
          <div class="p">
            11) Don't get hung up on feeling like you need to learn a bunch of languages. Once you learn one or two languages well, you will be able to sit down and start coding in pretty much any language in a matter of hours.
