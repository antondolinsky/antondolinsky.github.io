						To some this will probably be obvious, but to me it came as a bit of a revelation.
					</div>
					<div class="p">
						When I was learning how to program and fevereshly devouring every scrap of information I
						could find about the field's fascinating history, I of course multiple times came upon the
						famous aphorism "Premature optimization is the root of all evil", attributed to Tony Hoare.
						But I realize now that for the longest time I did not understand its fuller meaning. I
						always approached it as a bit of advice about implementation. But now I see that it applies
						to all aspects of computing, including to its abstract and mathematically beautiful
						aspects, the place where programming <i>is</i> mathematics.
					</div>
					<div class="p">
						Premature optimization prevents one from thinking about programs in a purely mathematical way.
						I don't want to be misunderstood when I write about approaching programming mathematially...
						There is a whole tribe of functional programming devotees who seem to believe that thinking
						of programming in terms of stateless functions is the most mathematical way to approach the
						matter. This I disagree with. Functional programming offers many wonderful advantages, but
						it is not uniquely mathematical as a programming paradigm. Indeed, I suspect that singling
						out functional programming as being more mathematical than other paradigms is often a form of
						premature optimization. Two common arguments against state are that it is hard to reason about
						and makes compiler optimizations more difficult. But both of these are optimization matters.
						The first is concerned with optimizing the programmer's performance, the second with
						optimizing that of the machine.
					</div>
					<div class="p">
						In mathematics, performance issues don't matter — well, unless you want them to. Beauty and
						understanding can be pursued for their own sake. And it is precisely this attitude that can,
						I think, lead to the finest programs. Performance is, of course, extremely important — not only
						in code that one writes for money, but also in code that one writes for art and science's sake.
						Generally, when programming, one would like to see results on some sort of finite time frame.
						But performance optimization often should not be the first step. To consider performance at
						the beginning is to shut off entire branches of possibility.
					</div>
					<div class="p">
						In fact, it is not only a concern with performance that binds the programmer's hands. In the
						broader sense, all concern with implementation does — including the concern with a specific
						language. Obviously it is very fruitful to think in language, but to think in an existing
						language often imposes an unnecessary limitation. In the space of the mind, one can freely
						extend whatever language one likes to think in, and many of the best approaches emerge from
						a space that is beyond any particular language. Really, all progamming is language design.
						Whenever one codes, one is extending the language that one is coding in.
					</div>
					<div class="p">
						Let me interpret Hoare's statement broadly and say: "Premature implementation is the root of
						much evil". A thought experiment: imagine that one is programming for machines that are
						capable of arbitrarily fast code execution and have arbitrarily large memories. How does this
						affect one's idea of what sort of solutions are possible? This opens the mind to thinking
						mathematically. Then, once a solution comes to mind, one can consider performance matters.
						If the performance of the original solution is unacceptable, then one can revise. It is
						even possible that at some future point computers will appear that are capable of executing
						the original solution. Even if they do not, still - one will at least have contributed to
						the world's stock of mathematical understanding.

						the same ground, and more.
